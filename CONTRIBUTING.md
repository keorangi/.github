# Contributing to Keorangi

Kia ora and thank you for your interest in contributing!

Keorangi is an independent maker studio crafting clean, user-first software products. Our work is still early, but contributions and ideas are welcome — especially from curious tinkerers, early adopters, and fellow indie hackers.
