# Kia ora, we’re Keorangi 👋

**Independent software makers crafting small, useful SaaS & web tools** — all built openly with care from our studio in Aotearoa (New Zealand).

🌱 Maker-first. Code-light. Craft-heavy.  
💡 Focused on building tools people actually use.

### 🚀 What We’re Building

We're experimenting with small software that:
- Solves practical problems for small teams and solo users
- Leans on platforms like **Shopify**, **Slack**, **Stripe**, and the **Open Web**
- Is built with transparency and an eye for clean, maintainable code

> 🧪 Current builds are in progress — stay tuned for public releases soon.
